# Rust 🦀 and WebAssembly 🕸

This small book describes how to use [Rust][] and [WebAssembly][] together.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone interested in compiling Rust to WebAssembly for fast,
reliable code on the Web. You should know some Rust, and be familiar with
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You don't need to be an expert in any of them.

Don't know Rust yet? [Start with *The Rust Programming Language* first.][trpl]

Don't know JavaScript, HTML, or CSS? [Learn about them on MDN.][mdn]

## How to read this book

You should read [the motivation for using Rust and WebAssembly
together][why-rust-wasm], as well as familiarize yourself with the [background
and concepts][background] first.

The [tutorial][] is written to be read from start to finish. You should follow
along: writing, compiling, and running the tutorial's code yourself. If you
haven't used Rust and WebAssembly together before, do the tutorial!

The [reference sections][reference] may be perused in any order.
