# Next Steps

This was an introduction to wasm-pack and also about using wasm code from npm. From here you could
actually improve on the project setup, expand out what your wasm code can actually do, or expand out
how you would use the package you've created. The whole wasm space is completely open so there's no
limit to what you can and can't do really! Go out there and try some cool new things. Happy hacking!
