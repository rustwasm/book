# Getting Started

If you want to be able to use Rust for wasm then you need an environment to be able to do that! If
you haven't already you'll need to install [rustup][rustup] (the official tool) in order to install
and manage different versions of the Rust compiler. Follow the instructions on the site to get it
installed on your machine. For the time being, you'll need Rust nightly when working with wasm:

```bash
# Install nightly
$ rustup install nightly

# Sets nightly for the current directory only
$ rustup override set nightly

# If you want nightly to be set globaly
$ rustup default nightly
```

Make sure the newest version of `wasm-bindgen-cli` is installed.

```bash
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --force
```

Once that's installed you'll need to get the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain.

```bash
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Next up if you're interested in making small wasm binaries you'll want to
install the [wasm-gc][wasm-gc] tool to make smaller binaries and to work around bugs
in the compiler toolchain for now:

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-gc
```

And finally if you're *really* interested in making small wasm binaries you'll
want to install `wasm-opt` from the [binaryen toolkit][binaryen].
