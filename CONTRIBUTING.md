# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to look at this document, which provides some 
guidelines on making your own contributions to the `rustwasm/book` project.
If you have an idea for making this document or anything else contained in the 
`rustwasm/book` project more useful, you can help by following the steps below.

## Filing an Issue

If you're using this `book` and come across out of date information, examples 
that don't work, or anything else that's wrong, you can help by filing an issue.

### Before Filing an Issue

First, review the [Code of Conduct](
https://github.com/rustwasm/book/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Then check the
[open issues](https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues) to see if someone is having 
the same problem as you. 

### Opening the Issue on Github

You can [create a new issue here](https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues/new).

If you're documenting a bug in one of the working code examples, it helps to 
include the following information in your issue:

```
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened?
```

If the program crashed please provide a full stack trace by setting this:

  ```bash
  export RUST_BACKTRACE=full
  ```

  and re-running your code so that it crashes again. Paste the output of that
  in your issue.
- Any other useful information you think could help diagnose the issue.
